# RandyBot
Randy 2.0, with the new firmware update.


## Quick Description

RandyBot is a chat bot for Discord that will generally get new features added to him as I see fit. At the moment he can play music in chat from youtube.
He can also do some basic things like Private Message users, say things Users request, and I am in the process of adding Soundcloud ability. 

## To Run

If you want to run randybot download the source code and install the latest version of Node/NPM. Install the required modules, get a discord/yotuube API key,
and add him to your Discord server. Easy!
